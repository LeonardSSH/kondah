**Kondah** is a micro framework that lets you create your own web framework. It's driven by a **plugin** architecture supported by it's own dependency container known as **Energizor**.

It's goal is to take away the opinions of the author and let you design a system that works for you, whilst having strong types and being able to share your own plugins that others can use.

As of now there's no official roadmap, but to give you a general idea of what's to come:

- Plugins (already implemented, but in review)
- Server Adapters (already implemented but needs more work)
- Dependency Injection (implemented)
- Inversion of control (implemented but in review)
- Injectable Scopes
- It's own CLI
- Interactive self hosted environment to quickly compose projects with your own or official plugins from Kondah.
