**Kondah** is a micro framework that lets you create your own web framework. It's driven by a **plugin** architecture supported by it's own dependency container known as **Energizor**.

Its goal is to take away the opinions of the author and let you design a system that works for you, whilst having strong types and being able to share your own plugins that others can use.

As of now there's no official roadmap, but to give you a general idea of what's to come:

- Plugins (implemented)
- Dependency Injection (implemented)
- Inversion of control (implemented)
- It's own CLI (very simple one has been implemented for now)
- Injectable strategies (extends Energizor's usecases, not implemented yet)
- Interactive self hosted environment to quickly compose projects with your own or official plugins from Kondah.
